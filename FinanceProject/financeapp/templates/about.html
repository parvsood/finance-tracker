                Being a human on earth in 2025 or in any year post, say 7 BCE guarantees having a relationship with
                money. The nature of that relationship is different for each one of us. But without exception an
                accompanying factor of anyone's relationship with money, either a constant or appearing, disappearing
                and reappearing, is anxiety.

                Where does this anxiety come from?

                It's the result of either a relationship with money that's not healthy or because of the lack of it.
                When there's anxiety due to the lack of money we know what we need to do, find ways to increase our
                income. But when the anxiety is despite having a source of income, then what can we do?

                It's Monday morning after a weekend of night-out, you open an app to check your bank balance, anxiety.
                The month is nearing an end, you check your balance to realise you don't even know where all the money
                went, anxiety. You overshot your mental budget for eating out in the first 10 days of the month,
                anxiety. The awareness that you're not doing well, after the deed is done, after cards have been swiped,
                after QRs have been scanned and money has been spent is useless and anxiety provoking.

                The awareness should be present before you swipe your card, or scan a QR code or write a cheque, so such
                actions can be consciously avoided.

                It's a blatant failure of our financial tools to not prioritise awareness. Perpetual Financial Awareness
                (not yet trademarked) is what we believe solves that anxiety. Tracker is designed in a way that
                prioritises financial products, riddled with visual noise that grabs your attention with nails in all
                directions, we have created Tracker, which not only delivers on its function but also in beauty and
                design.
                Another failure of our financial products is the lack of care. Finance in itself can be daunting, our
                tools don't need to be. But open any app and be ready to be dished out 20 options in 30 different
                colours. We want to stand out from that crowd by standing still. In the bustle of financial products,
                riddled with visual noise that grabs your attention with nails in all directions, we have created
                Tracker, which not only delivers on its function but also in beauty and design.

                We wish for Tracker to do its job and then get out of your way. We want you to come to Tracker for value
                and function, not cashback or rewards.
